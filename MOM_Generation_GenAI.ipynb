            "    * **Book Club:**  The next book club meeting will be held on August 7th. The book chosen is \"Inspired\" and is highly aligned with product management.  Daniel encourages all new hires to read this as well.\n",
            "    * **Interview Spreadsheet:** CS & Sales have populated a spreadsheet with customer contacts for meetings. Daniel requests a follow-up on this to ensure good coordination with the team and prompt meetings with customers. \n",
            "    * **Engagement Survey:** The monthly engagement survey will be run throughout Q3. Daniel asks everyone to complete the survey, which takes about a minute to fill out. The survey includes five quick questions and one free-form section for feedback.  Fabian did not receive the survey, so Jessica will resend it to him.  Karina did not receive it either.  Scott confirmed that the survey was sent and searched his email for the title of the survey, which is \"Pulse Survey\".  Anyone who did not receive the survey is requested to ping Daniel.\n",
            "    * **Customer Interviews:**  The team has a goal of three customer interviews per PM.  There is an OKR issue, so anyone who has not updated it recently is asked to do so.  There are only three weeks left until Q2, so Daniel encourages the team to invest time in scheduling these interviews.\n",
            "    * **Category Maturity Page:** Josh did a great job creating some new views for the Category Maturity page, including a flowchart showing the maturity level at a given point in time.  If anyone has not already reviewed the flowchart, they are asked to confirm or update the information.\n",
            "* **Team Updates:**\n",
            "    * **New Hires:** The team hired two new PMs, Gabe Weaver and Dov Hershkowitz.  Gabe will lead the third PM group, and Dov will serve as the APM monitoring. \n",
            "    * **Customer Results Language:** Christie and David worked to change some language around customer results. Daniel encourages everyone to review the changes.  Scott discussed the specific changes and highlighted the addition of a \"prioritize ruthlessly\" section.  Daniel explained that the change in language was due to the need to emphasize customer feedback over internal feedback. \n",
            "    * **Core Competencies:** Scott had the feedback that some of the text in the customer results document seems to focus on new scope rather than core competencies.  He suggests focusing on what the team does best.  Daniel agreed that the main point of the document was to prioritize and focus on what matters most, reiterating his previous message about focusing on what matters most first.\n",
