            "If it's like my family I am definite I definitely have no subjects. Yeah Daniel Hey, Eric. Hello. Welcome back Eric. Thanks so much. Yeah it's great to be here. Hi Virginia. Hello. All right, let's let's kick off. I want to start out with some reminders. First, we have a book club coming up on Inspired in 4 weeks on August 7th. I just reread it myself. It's uh it's a good read. It's highly aligned with how I think about product management, and does a good job of explaining why some of these things are important um that that I have also believe to be important. So, it's nice to have uh another voice explaining all of that. So, please do read that. I think I'm going to update the new higher onboarding dock and ask all new higher's to read this as well, so that we all everybody in the team is on the same page with respect to this book. Uh let's see. Uh reminder B. Remember there's this interview spreadsheet CSS and sales have populated that with a number of customer uh contacts for meetings. Please do follow up on that. I want to ensure good will with that team and uh follow up promptly with the uh meetings with these customers, so that that team can see that we're taking advantage of it. Third reminder, we've got a little engagement survey. I'm going to run this once a month in Q3 just to take a pulse, given all the change going on. Please do take a a minute to fill it out. It's five uh you know quick questions and then one free form where you can share whatever feedback you have. Fabian didn't receive it. I I'm pretty sure I went through my emails uh I think there was some um maybe it's on my end. But I I'm happy to fill it out, but I I I have you didn't get it? We need to get it to you. All right, I will uh I'll ask Jessica to resend that to you. Is anybody else in the same condition where you did not receive it? I don't recall, but is there a way to put the link to the survey in the uh agenda? Well, it's it's personal. It's uh It's tied back to your user ID so we can track uh which team you're on and that kind of thing. I do believe it's anonymous, but nevertheless, everyone has their own custom ID. So I'll ask Jessica to send it to Fabian and Karina. Anybody else? So I I just I haven't seen it. Got it. But I searched my email real quick um and it looks like that's the title of the email. So, if you just search for that in your in your Gmail, you should be able to find it if you got it. Pulse survey? Yeah. Culture ramp. Okay. Anybody else didn't get it? Please ping me. All right. Uh next reminder, we um we need we have a goal of at least three customer interviews per PM. There's an OKR issue out there. If you hadn't updated it lately, please do so. And uh remember we have 3 weeks until Q2 to hit our goals, so please uh please do invest the time to get those set up and get at least 3 done if you haven't already. Uh next one, category maturity page, last week, we talked about this. Josh did a great job of creating some new views uh one of which is sort of this flow chart showing how mature we're going to be at a given point in time, which raised questions about whether uh we were forecasting that accurately. If you haven't already, please go in and either confirm that it's accurate or update it. Thanks to Kenny for creating that issue. Uh somebody had a direction maturity page, you want to talk about that? Well, that was just me just trying to get you offense- it was just adding the link there. That's all. Oh, folks if you haven't seen the updates there for the charts, uh just check it out. Um So, Got it. So, it's a good way you can get a sense for like you know it's hard it's hard when it's in a tabular form, but when it's charted it's much easier to see like if if it's achievable or not uh based on some of the trends. Um, and there's also if you scroll down uh stage level trends as well. So, you can see how your stage in particular is trending or set to be trending. So, Great. Thanks, Josh. All right, some team updates. We hired a couple more PMs. We got a good rhythm going on hiring. Uh we hired Gabe Weaver, he originally came through the growth funnel. Uh but, we have a really strong candidate for that fourth slot. So, we're going to target Gabe for a third manage PM. The charter of that team is to be defined, but uh bottom line, we're going to have a third group in the manage area. And Gabe will lead that. And then Dov Hirshkowitz we just hired him as the uh APM monitoring. He's got a great background in monitoring and has most recently been at Elastic. So thank you to everyone who's been involved in the hiring loop. I know it's taking a lot of energy from everybody, but uh I think our hiring processes continues to pick up speed. Uh B2B uh worked with with Christy and David Sakamoto to change some language around customer results. Just wanted to make sure you all saw that. Uh so, there's the MR. Hey Scott on that one I just the uh there's a the diff highlights what is new content, I believe, and there's one section that is great, I can totally understand why we would add that about prioritize ruthlessly. But then the rest is I guess a bunch of formatting changes and I don't know if there's new content in any of the dog footing. I I guess is the TLDR the addition of that prioritize ruthlessly or is there some other uh point we were trying to make in this change? Oh, it's been a little while, I think uh there were a number of changes. But, before the hand book basically read that internal feedback is worth 10 times more than external feedback. And I understand why we want internal feedback because of dog footing and using our own products. It's it's a it's a great channel for feedback. But, I think it was sending the message that customers weren't nearly as important as internal opinion. And both Christy and I want to move off of that position. Like, we should be customer first and treat our own teams as a customer. But let's I don't I don't want people to interpret that our own internal opinion is worth 10 times more than a customer's opinion if that makes sense. So, it was mostly language wherever that showed up in the handbook. Gotcha. Okay. The one comment I had on this is that some of the text seems like we should focus on core competencies as opposed to new scope and uh like as in the we should focus on what we what we're best at. Um so, and I'm not Anyways, that that's one thought I had on this uh but I don't remember that being the point of it. Maybe it reads that way. I don't know, feel free to continue to suggest tweaks. The point was Let's prioritize and do what matters most first, just it's kind of what I've been preaching the whole time, like let's in your area, wherever that is, do what matters first. Don't try to do it all. uh P \n"
